# Aim & Reaction Trainer 
## Description :
Aim & Reaction Trainer is a simple mini games web app based on vanilla JavaScript to train reaction speed and aiming precision. The creation of this project is inspired by cognitive training platforms like [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/) and aim training minigames web app like [Aim Trainer](https://aimtrainer.io/).
## Features :
### Reaction Time Test
- **Visual Reflex Training**: Test your reaction speed with a red-to-green color change
- **Random Timing**: 3-5 second random delay to prevent anticipation
- **Performance Feedback**: Get instant feedback on your reaction time 
- **Too Early Detection**: Prevents cheating by detecting early clicks

### Aim Trainer
#### Basic Mode
- **Configurable Targets**: Set how many targets to hit (default: 20)
- **Sequential Training**: Targets appear one at a time for focused practice
- **Performance Metrics**: Track average time per target in milliseconds

#### Reflex Mode
- **30 Disappearing Targets**: Fixed challenge with targets that auto-disappear
- **Three Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy**: 1.5 seconds before target disappears
  - **Medium**: 1 seconds before target disappears  
  - **Hard**: 0.6 seconds before target disappears
- **Hit Ratio Tracking**: See how many targets you successfully hit out of 30
- **Random Positioning**: Targets appear at unpredictable locations
